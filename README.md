## RFM ANALYSIS || Tableau

The objective of this is to disseminate the key findings from the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis I carried out with Tableau. RFM analysis is a strategy for segmenting customers based on their most recent purchase, how frequently they make purchases, and how much money they spend. The RFM metrics are important predictors of customer behaviours since retention is influenced by recency, while frequency and monetary value determine a customer's lifetime value.
